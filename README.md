# Contract 18: P2P Lending System

## 📌 Project Description

This is a decentralized Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Lending System built using Solidity on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to request loans and have them funded directly by other users, removing intermediaries and making borrowing and lending more accessible and transparent.

## 🌟 Project Vision

To democratize financial lending and borrowing by providing a decentralized, trustless platform where users can seamlessly lend and borrow funds with full transparency, reduced fees, and faster access to capital — fostering financial inclusion for all.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Loan Requests**: Borrowers can create loan requests specifying the amount, interest rate, and repayment duration.
- **Direct Funding**: Lenders can view open loan requests and fund them directly using their crypto wallets.
- **Smart Contract Logic**: Automatically handles fund transfers, repayment validations, and ensures secure lending agreements.
- **Interest Handling**: Repayments are made along with pre-agreed interest directly to the lender.
- **Transparency**: All transactions and loan statuses are visible on-chain for auditability.

## 🔮 Future Scope

- **Collateralization**: Add support for collateral-backed loans to reduce lending risk.
- **Reputation System**: Introduce a scoring mechanism for both lenders and borrowers to promote trust.
- **NFT-based Loan Agreements**: Mint loan agreements as NFTs for portability and proof.
- **Multi-token Support**: Enable lending in multiple cryptocurrencies or stablecoins.
- **Dispute Resolution**: Integrate DAO-based dispute resolution mechanisms for failed repayments.
- **Front-End DApp**: Develop a user-friendly UI for seamless interaction with the contract.
